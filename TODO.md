# UX / usability

**Latency between triggering record and recording starting**

It takes a while. The yellow indicator in the menu bar also lies about when the recording actually starts, if you start speaking just as the indicator turns yellow, your first words will not be included in the recording.

**Streaming in transcription when pasting to cursor**

When pasting text to cursor, the transcription can be streamed in realtime / we can stop and start transcription in chunks so chunks can be pasted in realtime.

# Bugs

Sometimes it seems like the input monitoring janks up. We need better observability into what it has tracked to debug when this happens. Would be nice to have a log button just for what registered keys are registered as clicked down and released, with timestamps.
